# Course Project: Shiny Application and Reproducible Pitch - The Iris Dataset

This project consists of two tasks: 1) an app using Shiny and 2) a presentation using slidify.

Shiny's application consists of drawing the variables from the well-known iris dataset. The values of the variables will be drawn in a two-dimensional plot. Each point is plotted using a different color according to its class label. The user can select the variables from a drop-down list. Likewise, a message of the variables used in the X and Y axes will be printed.
